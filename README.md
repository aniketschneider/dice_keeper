dice_keeper
-----------

This is a Discord dice rolling bot. It's designed to work with tabletop RPG character sheets stored in Google Sheets, known as "character keepers." The idea is that you have your character sheets with various numerical stats in one worksheet, and then you have a separate worksheet called "Macros" with formulas that compute the modifiers for common, character-specific rolls. Currently the Google Sheets connector is specialized for Apocalypse World style moves, in that it assumes that they are all of the form 2d6 + modifier.
